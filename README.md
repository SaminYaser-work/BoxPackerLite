BoxPackerLite
=========

An implementation of the "4D" bin packing/knapsack problem i.e. given a list of items, how many boxes do you need to fit
them all in taking into account physical dimensions and weights.

Especially useful for e.g. e-commerce contexts when you need to know box size/weight to calculate shipping costs, or
even just want to know the right number of labels to print.
